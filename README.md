# YOLO Character Detection - Modern Family Edition

This repository contains a Python implementation of YOLO object detection using OpenCV's DNN module. The goal of this project was to train a YOLO model to recognize characters from the TV series **Modern Family**.

![Example Output](example.gif)

## Features
- Train a YOLOv8 model to detect Modern Family characters
- Export the trained model to ONNX format
- Perform object detection on images and video streams
- Display bounding boxes with class labels

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/modernfamilyYOLO.git
   cd modernfamilyYOLO
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dependencies
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PyYAML
- Ultralytics [optional] (for YOLOv8 training and exporting)

## Running Object Detection on an Image
```python
from yolo_predictions import YOLO_pred
import cv2

test = YOLO_pred('runs/detect/train/weights/model.onnx', 'config.yaml')
result = test.predictions("image.jpg")
cv2.imshow("prediction", result)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### Running Real-time Object Detection on a Video
```python
test.real_time_prediction("video.mp4")
```

## Based On
